Notes:

- python3 proc-lig.py # download new ligands, runs acedrg downloads pdbs and makes mtzs and refmac scripts
##- bash multisub-refmac.sh # run refmac for every script that doesn't have a log, creates "this_weeks_refmacs.table"
##- [wait]
- python3 pool-sub-1.py
the above doesn't make the refmacs table, so
- edit recover-refmac-table.sh and put in todays date
- run recover-refmac-table.sh to make the refmacs table for this week.
- edit refmac-log-analysis.py to set the refmac table for the analysis
- python3 refmac-log-analysis.py # find the logs files that had an error in the above generated refmacs table
- python3 compare-ligands.py 22_09_28_refmacs.table > 22_09_28_refmacs.log
- grep ^delta: 22_09_28_refmacs.log > deltas.table # finds how much the ligands have moved. Makes deltas.table
  # note in the above, 22_09_28_refmacs.table is just an example, you can use any number of table files.

- Rscript ligand-hist.r # make plots using deltas.table


Further extentions with Coot or gemmi

Coot:
  - learn coot API
  - depends on Coot installation
  - many functions available - most of the work is done

Gemmi:
  - learn GEMMI API
  - gemmi is easily installed usig pip3
  - more portable
  - fewer functions - most of the functions will need to be written from scatch
